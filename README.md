A program that reads a list of nonnegative integers and to display the largest integer, the smallest integer, and the average 
of all the integers and a count of how many integers were typed.  
The user indicates the end of the input by entering a negative (sentinel) value that is not used in finding the largest, smallest, 
average values, and count.  The average should be a value of type double so that it is computed with a fractional part.
